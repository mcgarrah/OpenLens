# OpenLens

[![Build Lens](https://github.com/mcgarrah/OpenLens/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mcgarrah/OpenLens/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is the Binary Build Repo for Lens Repository located here : https://github.com/lensapp/lens.git

However, this build does not require you to log in and includes only open source part. Download and use as is.

Go To Release to download your binary of type Linux , MacOS or Windows

If you have trouble about not seeing pod logs, remove old config files / extensions remaining from old Lens app.

**NOTE:** Auto Updater is now live starting with every binary downloaded from Latest tag or the corresponding release assets.

**NOTE:** MacOS users will have to [manually trust the app](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac), as it is currently not signed properly, see [Issue #1](https://github.com/MuhammedKalkan/OpenLens/issues/1)

## Issues

1. There is an issue for Windows that requires trusting the binary as it is unsigned.
2. The same issue exists for MacOS as well.
3. (more to come...)
